# Stock Price Movement Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on developing predictive models for stock price movements using historical price and volume data. The goal is to analyze and predict future stock price variations based on current market conditions.

## Project Description
The project aims to predict stock price movements by analyzing the difference between future stock prices and current prices. This is implemented through various time intervals (minutes, hours, or days) to capture different market dynamics.

### Key Features
- Historical stock data analysis
- Multiple prediction models
- Price movement calculation
- Volume analysis
- Time-series forecasting

## Dataset
The project utilizes historical stock data for several stocks, including:
- FPT
- MSN
- PNJ
- VIC

Each dataset contains:
- Price information
- Trading volume
- Timestamp data

## Technical Implementation
The project is implemented using:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data analysis libraries
- Machine learning frameworks
